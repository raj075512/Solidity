solidity prerequestics -- blockchain , ethereum .
solidity end with .sol file 
solidity has remix IDE and it can be online or offline depends on u .

solidity --> after compiling -->
get divided into 
1) ABI
2) byte code 


ABI--> for other smart contract intraction with a particular smart constact , we need ABI
byte code --> its further written in json format of opcode 
Opcode -> means the EVM machine has to conclude that code.




for conveting byte code to opcode ..

 go to etherscan site 
 because it is hexadecimal value , we can start with 0x(byte code)
 we get opcode ..



fact about contract comilation..

1)byte code is immutable 
2)contract bytecode is readable and can be shown public to trust
3)ABI is bridge between contract and application
4)contract does'nt have to be public



MAINNET AND TESTNET 
1)mainnet -->
   a)for main course online transection with real world ethereum 
   b)usually netowrk ID is equal to 1
   
2)TESTNET -->
   a) for testing purpose we use it with rinkeby test netowrk
   b) for netowrk ID is equal to 2, 3 and 42..
